Mean Optimal Transformation Approach
------------------------------------
The Mean Optimal Transformation Approach (MOTA) was developed for identiability analysis of nonlinear models. Since non-identifiable parameters are functionally related with other non-identifiable parameters, we can map the problem of an analytical analysis of the model structure onto the problem of detecting functional relations of parameter estimates.
